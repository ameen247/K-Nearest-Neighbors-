# K-Nearest-Neighbors

KNN on Customer Dataset 

K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm for supervised learning. Where the data is trained with data points corresponding to their classification. Once a point is to be predicted, it takes account the K nearest points to it to determines it's classification 

KNN Algorithm

1. Pick a value of K

2. Calculate the distance of unknown case from all the cases(Euclidian, Manhattan, Minkowski or Weighted)

3. Select the K-observations in the training data that are nearest to the unknown data point.

4. Predict the response of the unknown data point using the most popular response value from the K-Nearest Neighbors
